# Introduction

Deploifai is a MLOps service that allows you to build and deploy your machine learning models.

Deploifai is made for people and teams that want to move fast and build revolutionising technology! Going from a built AI model to a deployed AI model is just about 10 minutes away. The machine learning model is ready to run as a HTTP request triggered task without the need for you, the developer, to spend any time on making the application or the infrastructure.

## Why Deploifai?

We believe that developers do not need to waste any of their time in setting up machine learning inference servers while they are building the next big thing, powered by AI, that will change the world. We let developers focus on their technology and we build everything else to ensure that the Machine Learning model can reach their end-users with complete reliability and uncompromising performance.

## How it works

You have to provide 4 things in order to make a deployment using Deploifai:

1. Model weights and configurations
2. A python function for running a task
3. Requirement files for the python environment

These files are compressed into a zip package that you will need to upload later.

Now, you can go to your dashboard and create an application, connect your cloud service account via IAM user details, and upload the compressed zip package. You are ready to deploy! Once the servers are deployed, we will provide an HTTP endpoint that will trigger the execution of the task you just created.

It is that simple! All the servers belong to your cloud service account and never leave your ownership. You can even make modifications to them and manually configure them yourself and you maintain the complete control over the infrastructure!

We evision to make a disruption in Machine Learning the same way Expo did for React Native mobile development!
